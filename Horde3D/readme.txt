Horde3D requires an OpenGL 2.0 compatible graphics card with the latest drivers.
A GeForce 6 or Radeon X1000 series card is the minimum requirement to run the samples.

The source code of the engine and tools is included in the SDK. It has the following dependencies:

	- XMLParser by Frank Vanden Berghen
		http://www.applied-mathematics.net/tools/xmlParser.html
	- stbi by Sean Barrett
		http://nothings.org
	- GLFW 2.6 for window management in samples
		http://glfw.sourceforge.net/
		
These libraries are included directly as code or precomplied binaries in the SDK.


Release Notes:
	
	This is another major release which finally brings Horde3D to a stable version. A
	plenty of new features have been added: occlusion culling, API-based render-to-texture
	for reflections and other effects which require several cameras, software skinning,
	stereo rendering, sorting of scene nodes by depth and orthographic camera projections.
	Besides these new features, many smaller improvements and optimizations were done and
	the usage guide has been rewritten to provide more detailed information.


Special thanks go to the University of Augsburg for supporting this project!

Description of included samples
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chicago
-------

This sample uses a simple crowd simulation to show how Horde3D can
be used to render environments and a plenty of animated models.
The demo supports forward and deferred rendering which can be
selected by modifying the pipeline_Chicago.xml file.

Input:

	Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around.
	Hold down LSHIFT to move faster.
	Space freezes the scene.
	F1 sets fullscreen mode.
	F3 switches between forward and deferred shading.
	F7 toggles debug view.
	F8 toggles wireframe mode.
	F9 toggles FPS display.
	ESC quits the application.

Notes on content:

	The character model was created by Sirda from TurboSquid.
	Some of the textures are taken from the ATI Radeon SDK and are thus
	copyrighted by ATI Technologies, Inc.
	

	
Knight
------

This sample shows a knight model with reflections coming from a cube map. The
pipeline applies high dynamic range lighting with simple tone mapping and a
bloom effect. The knight has a particle system attached to the tip of his sword
which results in some interesting graphical effects. Using the keyboard it is
possible to blend seamlessly between two animations.


Input:

	Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around.
	Hold down LSHIFT to move faster.
	Use 1 and 2 to blend between character animations.
	Space freezes the scene.
	F1 sets fullscreen mode.
	F3 switches between hdr and standard forward lighting.
	F7 toggles debug view.
	F8 toggles wireframe mode.
	F9 toggles FPS and information display.
	ESC quits the application.

Notes on content:

	The character model and animations were created by Rob Galanakis (www.robg3d.com)
